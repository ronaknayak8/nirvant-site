so the whole team section tsx shuld have one big title like meet our team above everything

and the images are squeezed up at one side why
and how we shuld go about the image position 

like we have two founder and co founder 

and varius other 

and at last at img section for size do point out which part to modify for resize, and what possible option are for position of card 

so they 

also do make sure all things are responsive in mobile or desktop, ie flexible



first up all , i want only name and role shown in here , 

when we hover that part it shuld highlight with some dark color that part only

we have two person or three for founder and co founder category 

so postion of these person be in centre

and the whole card  size is small why , i want to change it, keep the sizze flexible 

point me where i can change size and positon of card, and bg color, 
with examples

and ofc in mobile one person below another
